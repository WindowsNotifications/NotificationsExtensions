# NotificationsExtensions

The official Microsoft NotificationsExtensions library. Generate tile, toast, and badge notifications for Windows via code, with the help of IntelliSense, instead of directly using XML.

**Supports adaptive tiles and adaptive/interactive toast notifications for Windows 10!**

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local hard drive
2. Open your own project (Windows 10 app, server code, etc)
3. **If you're writing a Windows 10 app, reference "Windows 10" -> "NotificationsExtensions.Win10.WinRT"**
4. If you're writing a server app (non-WinRT), reference "Windows 10" -> "NotificationsExtensions.Win10.Portable"
5. After the project is referenced, the namespace is "NotificationsExtensions" and each category of notifications are under their own namespace like "NotificationsExtensions.Tiles" or "Toasts" or "Badges".
